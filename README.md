# Work Day Planner

## Overview

A work day planner to write notes based on a certain time block. The current hour time you are in will be green, past time blocks will be grey, and future time blocks will be red. You will be able to make notes in each time block and click save to view your information as you wish. Your notes will remain when the page is refreshed or left and came back to. The user can also view the current date at the top of the page. For this project I was provided some starter code, and built upon that.
